## Schema

We used excalidraw to produce our schemas : https://excalidraw.com/

Don't forget to push the original file to the repository (example : https://github.com/etf1/etf1.github.io/blob/prez-archi-mytf1/content/post/2020/architecture/presentation/images/persisted-queries.excalidraw)

Once your schema is OK you can export it at SVG file and compress it with https://vecta.io/nano.
